/// It is not a View Model or some kind of Presenter. It is the missing piece of information. If your view controller requires a
/// `productID` to display its content, and the `productID` is a `UUID`, then the type of `Context` is the `UUID`. The internal logic
/// belongs to the view controller. `Context` answers the questions *What to I need to present a ProductViewController* and *Am I
/// already presenting a ProductViewController for this product*.
